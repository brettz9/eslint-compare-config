Thoughts on CLI options:
  - load config directly from file
  - (default) load config using eslint itself from a target file location
  - output straight json
  - output a compatibility score
  - output textual diff

getLiteralConfig:
  support all file types: js, yaml, json, key in package.json
    http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring
  attempt to load extended configurations? would have to replicate eslint path lookups, merging...

getDifferences:
  - include shared rule list
  - include shared plugin list

For textual diff:
  - include colors?
  - what id we didn't just do a console.log? What would be a better format?
  - include counts for rules and plugins: missing on left, shared, missing on right
  - A better way to display the general config diffs?

Add tests!
